docker-oldgit [![Docker Build Status](https://img.shields.io/docker/build/iamdanfox/oldgit.svg)]()
=============

Dockerfile which builds git 1.7.1 from source.

Building from source was necessary because 1.7.1 was released in April 2010 so package managers don't seem to have it anymore.

See https://hub.docker.com/r/iamdanfox/oldgit/.
